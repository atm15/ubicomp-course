    <h2>Course Description</h2>
    The aim of this class will be to introduce you to ubiquitous computing (ubicomp). We will focus on how traditional topics of computing have evolved to support the vision of a connected, portable, and a human-centric computing environment. The course will include discussion into contribution of various fields, including human-computer interaction, embedded computing, computer vision, distributed systems, machine learning, and electrical engineering. You will gain practical experience in developing sensing systems in different application domains, such as activity recognition, health sensing, gestural interaction, etc.

    The course will be a combination of lectures, tutorials, class discussions, and demonstrations. You will be evaluated on your class participation, reading summaries, and individual assignments/mini-projects (6 assignments in total).

    Lectures and discussion will occur during the first half of class-time and the second half will consist of tutorials on how to build and prototype various ubicomp systems. The assignments will help you practice these concepts. You are allowed to work in groups to learn the material, but are required to complete and submit individual work.

    There are no pre-requisites for the course.
