    <h2>Course Description</h2>
    The aim of this class will be to introduce the students to ubiquitous computing. We will focus on how traditional topics of computing have evolved to support the vision of a connected, portable, and a human-centric computing environment. The course will include discussion into contribution of various fields, including human-computer interaction, embedded computing, computer vision, distributed systems, machine learning, and electrical engineering. The students will gain practical experience in developing sensing systems in different application domains, such as activity recognition, health sensing, gestural interaction, etc.

    The course will be a combination of lectures, tutorials, class discussions, and demonstrations. Students will be evaluated on their class participation, reading summaries, and individual assignments/mini-projects (5 assignments in total).

    There are no pre-requisites for the course.

    This class is intended to be highly interactive and students will be asked to kick off the discussion for that day’s topic based on the assigned readings. Prior to class, all students are required to post a paragraph summary of the reading(s) and questions or discussion points to the message board. The highlighted papers on the schedule are the required papers, but additional optional papers are also listed that you can use for reference either in this class or in the future.

    Lectures and discussion will occur during the first half of classtime and the second half will consist of tutorials on how to build and prototype various ubicomp systems. There will be 5 individual assignments to practice these concepts. Although not required, you are allowed to work in groups to learn the material, but are required to complete and submit individual work.
