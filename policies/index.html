<h2>Reading Summaries</h2>
<p>You are expected to read the papers or watch the videos before each lecture to prepare for an engaging and meaningful in-class discussion. You are also expected to submit summaries on Canvas (<a href="https://canvas.uw.edu/courses/1131076/discussion_topics">link</a>) by midnight before the corresponding lecture (see class schedule).</p> 

<p>The response should be at least 5 sentences long. The post can summarize the paper in your own words, propose future directions that the work can take, pose questions about the work, or follow-up on someone else's response.</p>

<h2>Grading, Late Policy, and Academic Conduct</h2>

<p>If you anticipate being absent during a class when an in-class demo is supposed to be given, you may demo your assignment at a later time, but you must submit your code on time and email the instructors(s) beforehand to make arrangements. Late code submissions will not be able to earn points for the demo portion of the grade, but can still earn full points for the code portion. Exceptions will only be given in extreme or unforeseen circumstances. Late reading summaries will not be accepted.</p>

<p>Students are expected to follow all of the university's academic codes of conduct (<a href="http://www.washington.edu/teaching/cheating-or-plagiarism/">link</a>) in regards to both collaboration and plagarism. Although we encourage students to discuss assignments in general terms, the assignments are meant to be completed individually. While it is okay to look for help online through sources like StackOverflow and Github, blatantly copying an entire program with or without an understanding of how it works is unacceptable. In the end, the code you write must be your own. Cases of cheating will be given a 0 for the assignment without a means of making up the points. If you are at all in doubt about whether a particular activity is appropriate under this context, please email the instructors for clarification. </p>
