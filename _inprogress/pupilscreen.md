title: 'PupilScreen: Using Smartphones to Assess Traumatic Brain Injury'
summary: |
    Before a person suffering from a traumatic brain injury reaches a medical facility, measuring their pupillary light reflex (PLR) is one of the few quantitative measures a clinician can use to predict their outcome. PupilScreen is a smartphone app and accompanying 3D-printed box we are developing that combines the repeatability, accuracy, and precision of a clinical device with the ubiquity and convenience of the penlight test that clinicians regularly use in emergency situations.
