title: 'Why smartphone health apps?'
summary: |
    <p>Take this hypothetical situation. Imagine that you are a physician. You have a patient who walks in, distraught and clutching their phone. They exclaim that they want to get tests done because an app told them they have lung cancer. What are you, the physician, supposed to do in this situation? Is the patient's concern enough to order a test? How are you supposed to trust the app? The obvious answer would be FDA approval, but I'm not sure that an FDA stamp solves everything. Mobile health screening apps are installed on phones that don't come from or stay in the clinic. Everyone has their own phone, which can have their own respective quirks. What if a diagnosis relies on the microphone and my microphone was damaged by water? Ideally, developers will have measures in place to check the quality of the data their systems analyze, but can they account for every possible issue? I know that this is a question that the FDA is actively thinking about right now, but no matter their decision, won't some physicians and doctors still be skeptical? Also, I'm sure apps for different conditions would lead to different actions from the physician. If an app says that someone has cancer, a doctor would be hesitant to immediately order a biopsy; if an app says that someone has high blood pressure, though, that's something that the doctor can check themselves with no extra cost. Where do clinicians draw the line? Is it simply a matter of whether a standard clinical test is free or not? The way that the data is presented is also important. Saying that a person has "high blood pressure" versus "112/83 mmHg" blood pressure have different consequences in terms of trust for the clinician or stress for the patient.</p>
    <p>In the end, I view the area of mobile health as one that should focus on <i>screening</i> apps, not necessarily <i>diagnostic</i> apps. When met with uncertainty, these apps can give more false positives (saying you might have the disease when you don't) instead of false negatives (saying you might not have the disease when you do). At the very least, it gets a person's foot in the door of the clinic that may not have gone otherwise. Do other people see it this way though? In developing or remote regions, there may not be a clinical test to follow up with, so maybe traveling physicians may just take the word of the apps. We could just end up with WebMD-syndrome to the extreme. I think it would be really interesting to survey clinicians on these kinds of questions.</p>
