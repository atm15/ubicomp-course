My dissertation is on creating smartphone apps that systematize and automate the ways that doctors use their senses - sight, hearing, touch, smell, and taste - to detect symptoms more accurately, precisely, and consistently. My graduate work has focused on diagnosing conditions that manifest through symptoms in the eye, including jaundice for pancreatic cancer and non-responsive pupils for traumatic brain injuries. My projects cover a wide array of skills, including machine learning, computer vision, signal processing, and user interface design.
