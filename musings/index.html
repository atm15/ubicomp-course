This is just a collection of things that are on my mind. They aren't technical research ideas (but I have a lot of those and know where to find more if you need them). Some of these are questions that I think are relevant to the ubiquitous computing field. I love to think through them in my head and hope to write about them as I get older and experience more in the field. I've also left some quotes that I think are personally relevant.
