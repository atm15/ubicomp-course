title: 'Assignment 3 - Step Counting on an Arduino'
nickname: 'A3'
assigned_class_index: 5
due_class_index: 7
summary: |
    You will recreate your step counter from Assignment 1 on a Arduino. Your algorithm can be the exact same as it was before (assuming it worked well). Like before, you can assume that the Arduino is in a fixed position in your hand.
starting_materials: TODO
optional: |
    Attempt to detect steps in any orientation and posture.
grading: |
    (60 points) We will briefly examine your code to ensure that you are using some form of signal processing to calculate a step count. <br/>
    (40 points) You will take 20 steps with the Arduino in your hand during class. For full credit, your app must correctly count the number of steps within 1 (19-21 steps). -5 points for each extra or missing step beyond the first.
