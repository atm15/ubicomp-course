title: 'Assignment 3 - Step Counting on an Arduino'
nickname: 'A3'
assigned_class_index: 5
due_class_index: 7
summary: |
    You will recreate your step counter from Assignment 1 on an Arduino. Your algorithm can be the exact same as it was before (assuming it worked well). Like before, you can assume that the Arduino is in a fixed position in your hand. The step count should be displayed in binary using the board's NeoPixel LEDs.
grading:
- (50 points) We will briefly examine your code to ensure that you are using some form of signal processing to calculate a step count.
- (50 points) To test your app's performance, you will take 10 steps with the phone in your hand during class. You will get full credit if your step counter is within 1 (i.e., it estimates 9-11). -5 points for each extra or missing step.
<!-- extra_credit:
- (+5 points) Demonstrate that your step counter can work for any orientation (e.g., in hand face up, up against the ear). You can assume that the Arduino will stay in roughly the same orientation the whole time.
- (+5 points) Your demo can work on both yourself and one of the instructors. -->
