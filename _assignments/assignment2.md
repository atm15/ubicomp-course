title: 'Assignment 2 - Gesture Recognition on an Android Phone'
summary: |
    Develop an optical heart rate monitoring app using the built in camera on your android tablet. There is a technique called photoplethysmography (PPG), which consists of detecting changes in blood volume during a cardiac cycle. By illuminating the skin and measuring the observed optical changes, it is possible to extract heart rate. In this assignment, you can assume the person will be holding their finger steady on the phone’s camera to simplify the signal processing. Normally, you can just use the LED near the camera as the illumination source, but our lablets don’t have an LED. You’ll need to use a light source for a second device, such as your phone. At a minimum you will need to low pass filter the data you will be extracting from the camera prior to using peak detection to extract heart rate. For the app, we ask you to both plot the heart rate signal on the interface and show the extracted heart rate in real time. Please have your application installed and ready to show in class on the due date and also submit your source code to the assignment submission site.
