title: 'Assignment 1 - Sampling and Processing Accelerometer Data: Step Counter on Android'
summary: |
    Develop an android app that counts steps. Design an interface that shows the number of steps as a user walks with the tablet in their hand. You will be using the raw data from the accelerometer and/or gyroscope to complete this task. The data will require some very simple signal processing before you can count the number of steps. Just focus on the basics in this assignment. We will do more advanced signal processing in subsequent assignments. You can use peak detection, zero crossing, or your own technique for counting. You can assume the user only holds the tablet in a fixed posture in their hands. You are welcome to assume a different placement or posture of the tablet or phone, but please be sure to document how the device needs to be held somewhere on the interface. Optional â€“ If want a challenge, attempt to detect steps in any orientation and posture. Please have your application installed and ready to show in class on the due date and also submit your source code to the assignment submission site.
