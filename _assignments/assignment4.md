title: 'Assignment 4 â€“ 3D Printing'
nickname: 'A4'
assigned_class_index: 7
due_class_index: 8
summary: |
    You will create a 3D model for a case that will house your Arduino, battery, wires, etc. for Assignment 5. Assignment 5 will be like the gesture detector in Assignment 5, only that the data collection will happen on the Arduino. With that in mind, you will want to build something that will mount the Arduino on your hand, wrist, or wherever else you want to do gestures (e.g., ankle, head). The part should not be larger than 3 in &#10799; 3 in &#10799; 3 in so that it can be printed in a reasonable amount of time time. You are only required to give us the STL file; we will deal with printing the object itself. If you would prefer to print your part yourself for whatever reason, let us know in the submission tool. Depending on resources, all prints may not be finished until Assignment 5 is due.
grading:
- (100 points) We will sanity check your model to make sure that it is feasible to print and reasonable in size. -5 for each minor mistake that requires a fix. -10 for each major mistake. -20 if the model cannot be printed.
