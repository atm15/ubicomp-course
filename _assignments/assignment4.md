title: 'Assignment 4 – 3D Printing'
summary: |
    You will create a 3D model for a case (and print it out) that will house the sensor and microcontroller for A5. In A5, you’ll build a bluetooth-enabled wearable heart rate monitor using the parts we provide you. To get the best heart rate signal, you will need a way to securely attach the sensor and microcontroller on your finger. Your task will be to design some sort of housing that will hold the sensor, the microcontroller, and the batteries as well as attach to your finger. You will turn in your actual print out when you submit A5, but we ask you submit your 3D model (in STL format) as indicate on the schedule. This gives you some time to tweak the design (if needed) after you start working on A5 and prior to actually printing the part. Submit your assignment on the assignment submission site.
