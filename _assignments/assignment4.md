title: 'Assignment 4 â€“ 3D Printing'
nickname: 'A4'
assigned_class_index: 6
due_class_index: 8
summary: |
    You will create a 3D model for a case that will house your PSoC for Assignment 5. Assignment 5 will be like the gesture detector in Assignment 5, only that the data collection will happen on the PSoC. With that in mind, you will want to build something that will mount the PSoC on your hand, wrist, or arm. If you would are inspired to make something that would mount the PSoC somewhere else on your body (e.g., ankle, forehad), it is fine as long as you ask us ahead of time. You are only required to give us the STL file; we will deal with printing the object itself. Depending on resources, all prints may not be finished until Assignment 5 is due.
grading: |
    (100 points) We will sanity check your model to make sure that it is feasible to print and reasonable in size. -5 for each minor mistake that requires a fix. -10 for each major mistake. -20 if the model cannot be printed.
