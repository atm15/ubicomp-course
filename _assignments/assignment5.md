title: 'Assignment 5 â€“ Microcontrollers and Sensors'
summary: |
    You will build a wireless wearable heart rate monitor using the micro-controller, Bluetooth, and PPG modules we provided in class. The aim of this project is learn how to write basic micro-controller code, interface with an analog sensor, and stream data to a mobile device using Bluetooth. Using the sample code provided in class and from your experience from the previous assignments, you will sample raw data from the PPG sensor and do some pre-processing (basic filtering) on the micro-controller itself and send this pre-proposed data in real-time to the android device using Bluetooth. On the android, you will write an app that collects this data, further processes the data (peak counting or frequency tracking) to determine the heart rate. Your android app should also graph the heart rate in real time. You are welcome to architect the system how you like, but we ask that you do some processing on the micro-controller. It is tempting to stream all the raw data from the PPG sensor to the android device and process everything there. Sometimes this makes sense, but many times with power constrained devices you want to reduce the amount of wireless transmission to conserve power. Your wearable monitor should be able to operate while someone is walking around, so your 3D printed case will be critical in holding your sensor and hardware firmly in place on you finger. You will submit your arduino sketch file for your micro-controller, the android source, your final case design (STL file), and a video of your system working.
